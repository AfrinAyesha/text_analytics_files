JSb4_FxDciY,"shein is still my go to shopping app, weather it’s cancelled or not, shein always provides with the best prices",The problem is actually that they aren't being canceled. So many people I know and tons of influencers as well keep promoting and buying from Shein. My friends just say that they are broke and that is their reasoning. But it's things that are unnecessary. Like you have plenty of clothes. That skirt is absolutely not a reason.,Damn and I just ordered stuff from shein before I even watched this 
JSb4_FxDciY,never ordering shein again :D,Shein and Romwe do this it is really sick and we need to but a stop to it and shed light on the whole thing!!,"Dang, everyone i know buys shein"
JSb4_FxDciY,Nah shein is perfect,"I can only afford shein, right ? They have mum and dad to mind them . I think I buy them food at least because I buy what they make .",Istg if they cancel shein I’m turning into the night stalker.
JSb4_FxDciY,Shein is ban in India and i am so happy about it,I remember a while back I wanted to buy from shein but my mom told me not to I complained to her because it was hard to find places with clothes with pretty designs like sheins little did I know the truth but either way I’m glad I was stopped,Everybody just going on about shein when hundreds of big companies like nike do it to 
JSb4_FxDciY,dam I just put an order on Shein not to log ago lol,Honestly shein is the only brand I can afford so I'll keep shopping from there like for example other brands are like expensive soo,I just ordered from shein yesterday 
JSb4_FxDciY,Lol all SHEIN did was change the name of the company to TEMU. SHEIN is not going anywhere.,As long as I can buy items I’m still making purchases. All big corporations are corrupt. Y’all I’m not drawing the line at SHEIN. You think they are the only company with sketchy sweatshops in China? Your iPhone was most likely built by a slave so go throw that away…I’ll wait,DUDE.. I WAS ABOUT TO TELL MY DAD IF I CAN GET LEG WARMERS FROM SHEIN??!
JSb4_FxDciY,Bro shein is already banned in Morocco lol,"It’s funny cause now some people are gonna run around saying it’s wrong to buy from SHEIN, but won’t go donate to the families in China or India. They’ll just spend their money on H&M, a different fast fashion brand. Literal virtue signaling at its finest","Ofc i see this after I just placed a $4,000 order from Shein …."
JSb4_FxDciY,no i’ll always buy from shein IDGAF LOL,Would it really benefit the children if people all stopped buying from Shein or would they just have to find some other low paying job at some other company,Shein even copied popflex by blogilates - Cassy Ho
JSb4_FxDciY,"Nah I'm still buying from SheIn lol, their clothes are good quality so idrc how they make them","YES, I’m going to be the bad person here!!! I’m almost sure Shein hosts a lot more small sellers than the HUGE names that have actually been using people around the world.

Call centers, Huge brands. The 1% just wants to keep the money in their circle, simple.  But they know people can be stupid and probably will believe them.

The 1% rules the world by their biggest weapon; Propaganda.

Use your brains.",I found this out months ago and told my mom who always buys from SHEIN but she didn’t understand bc she didn’t fully understand English and now she still buys from SHEIN.
JSb4_FxDciY,Ah well. We all have to make a living somehow. Just ordered a bomb ass two piece from Shein. You kids do an amazing job so please keep up the good work!,Yes shein (and pretty much all other companies) suck but like this was proven false,Please boy cott shein they steal designs from people who worked har and they dont even give credit
lHNiD7lJo48,The best reviewer,"ok i don't live somewhere where people shop at shein but we have apps here that have a bunch of sellers that sell things usually from china , indonesia or locally . And the apps usually would have what shein have . And tbh shein is really expensive if you compare to what you got and the price . Trust me they do hella mark-up of the prices . Example you bought a 15 dollar tshirt , they usually would be 5 dollar or even cheaper . Maybe that's why the ""brand"" aren't as popular or known in my country .",wait shein is bigger than amazon. did anyone  know this?
lHNiD7lJo48,yay!! i love when u review shein!! p.s. i was watching your tiktoks this morning!!,I HATE shein bc they just steal designs from the underdog companies and sell their designs for cheap!!! This has happened too many times and no one’s even doing anything about it. No fair!!!,"“Shein is bigger than amazon”
Jeffrey Bezos: and i took that personally"
lHNiD7lJo48,Every time I see stuff about Shein I'm always so happy I haven't ever bought anything from them!  But I kinda want to see the quality of the SheinX stuff?,"Something that a lot of people don't care about is the fact that the Chinese government is totally okay with slave labor hence why corporations are also allowed to do it. Workers are ripped off both ways whether they work for their country or a foreign company. Labor rights aren't that advanced in China folks this is coming from someone who has worked in China. As bad as fast fashion is and these companies having questionable morals I won't tell anyone how they should spend their money also if you're well off obviously you can afford to pay for more pricey clothes by companies that are less questionable ethics wise. However, I'm not going to blame poor people for buying stuff off of Shein if that's all they could afford. Gotta think about your privilege too before you go off on those who shops at these places.",I cannot with shein never have I ever purchased and will not
lHNiD7lJo48,Yes purchase lol. I need to know!!! I've never ordered from SheIn but I have a lot hearted,"I have bought a couple of times from shein and I do feel really terrible for it now because of all the bad things it’s just that my family can’t afford to buy like expensive clothes… and most things here are expensive to me… 

Most people say like buy at thrift stores or second hand stores but there are stores 2 problems I have with them. There are very few of them where I live and like last time I went to one there were either A: little kid’s clothes like for a tiny 10 year old- which I would never be able to fit into because I’m very curvy 16 year old- or B: literally just grandparents old clothes that would look disgusting… on me and I actually care about what I look like and again sizes are just horrible for me…and they aren’t actually that cheap as people say not at least when I went there… 

But also… people need to start calling out other brands too not just shein… they aren’t the only company who have child labour and all of that yet it’s like only them who gets called out because they are big I guess… Like H&M which I am also guilty of buying from but… I know here in my country it’s the law for like good working conditions so the workers of them that work here do have it good but most stuff probably isn’t made in my country…",Finally someone speaking facts about Shein
lHNiD7lJo48,Oh my good shein stole best of both worlds from Hannah Montana that is a song from Miley cyrus ,"But everyone still buys Apple products, Nike products, Victoria’s Secret, alcoholic beverages,  fresh produce, nestle products, etc. I agree shein is an unethical company but y’all forget that just about most everyday items the public uses are also products of child/forced labor.","I’ve never had a problem with SHEIN , until I brought house cameras ."
lHNiD7lJo48,If you sold it for cheaper I wouldn't need to use Shein lol,Lmao so yall bashing Shein for doing some ALL companies do ANDDD yall are mad about the treatment shein workers are getting but ig yall are also forgetting thats literally EVERY EMPLOYEE IN CHINA,Bro just stop hateing on shein
lHNiD7lJo48,Lol at that striped dress website vs reality. It seems like inconsistency may be one of the biggest issues for Shein?,I stopped shopping from Shein when I find out about the things you mentioned but also how they make the clothes cheap by using dangerous materials like high percentages of lead and micro plastics that go into the water supply when you wash them ,"Click buy! Want to see what was purchased and if it’s the same quality! Weary on SHEIN, like it but the quality"
lHNiD7lJo48,I'm happy that shein was banned in India,Shein won't last long When you adopt the Internet as your highest provider you will accept the internet's terms of nothing lasts forever,Shein's marketing team is they can even turn a Shein-hater to their customer 
lHNiD7lJo48,I never buy anything from shein this is how creeped out I feel LOL,"I agree, however some people don’t have money to buy from small brands or designee brands. So fast fashion is how they can feel well dressed. I like SHEIN fir work clothes.",After me just ordering from shein 
lHNiD7lJo48,when i ordered stuff from Shein it was actually great quality and all that stuff lol,"This is my thought on Shein, I purchased two jumpsuits from them for $20 each and I purchase a jumpsuit from Nordstrom for $120. First, let me give my take on the one from Nordstrom, I purchased the jumpsuit a year ago and still haven't worn it, the sleeve of the jumpsuit turns on the arms and looks very unappealing, you would have to wear a jacket over it, second, it was so thin, you could see through it. Now on to Shien, every single time I wear one of their jumpsuits, EVERY SINGLE time, I get tons compliments. The quality is better than the one from Norstrom. I buy my clothes according to what I like, I have very expensive name brand clothes, shoes and purchases, you could catch me only any given day with a $10 dress on and $200 pair of shoes. As I have gotten older, I think it is a waste of money to buy expensive or name brands, clothes, shoes, and purses go out of style and I would buy so many clothes that about time I wanted to wear them, they were no longer in style. But each their own, spend your money where and how you like it and far as how Shein treats their works, if you are black, that is about every company out there, just my opinion and everyone have a blessed day.",shein also has a lot of child labour accusation
9uVt0dTZUEA,Hey James so my sister loves SHEIN (not make up) but she always say that there lashes are great I hope you could do a part 2 and try them thank you!,i mean i am not a professional makeup artist so i dont need anything too special and shein helps anyways thank you james,NEXT CAN YOU DO A MAC REVIEW
9uVt0dTZUEA,"This is perfect. I had bought the shein brush set that you used in this video and I also wanted to purchase the rest of the products, so this review is great!!!","I hate shein a lot, I got a foundation they said was ALLERGY FRIENDLY and I got a huge allergic reaction.",alr im gonna get a SHEIN lipstick now
9uVt0dTZUEA,Pro tip with shein reviews ones with pictures are the best!!!,"I started with SHEIN makeup , the concealer wasn’t that bad but then again I was a beginner I have 2 or 3 makeup pallets from SHEIN, they aren’t to good but I only used a few colors , and they actually still gave me a decent look how ever like you said supper powdery and hard to blend, I now have a james Charles pallet a simpsons pallet and ngl a few 5 below pallets that I use the highlights on , there actually pretty decent",Plsss pls pls can u do a video of unboxing advent calendar ( especially the body shop) pls I have subscribed for 2 years
9uVt0dTZUEA,Your the best  btw this week i ordered some stuff form Shein like :eyepatches٫face masks ect.,"SHEIN is also controversial because it’s not ethical at all. If you look on any websites that show you how ethical a shop is (very helpful btw we don’t wanna burn from climate change) they will not recommend it at all. SHEIN is cruel to animals, the environment and their workers get paid in cents. Come on, people.",You should rate SHEIN clothes
9uVt0dTZUEA,considering its from SHEIN its really good!!!,"Shein makeup is kinda a thief, like a bootleg of a good mark. I tried it, it came even worse than you could expect",My sister has that lash curler but in purple from SHEIN!
9uVt0dTZUEA,SHEIN have the best makeup,i think it doesn't look too bad but its the cakeyness on with the foundation and blush mixed with highlighter for me lmao but that itsn't your fault its the shein products,People rate stuff 5 stars on SHEIN so we can get points from it
9uVt0dTZUEA,"For shein, thats perfect!",Shein has good makeup type. He just acted too much in the video saying it bad  dumb,I want to see him try multiple outfits with only SHEIN clothes
9uVt0dTZUEA,Wait hold on that accualy looks really good!!! especialy for shein products.,Honestly I like the eyeshadow makeup and the products from shein arend so bad,He was just overreacting to the facts that he knows twas’ from shein.
9uVt0dTZUEA,JK ITS ADORABLE!!!! nvm ITS SHEIN,I just noticed this but she glam is a whole different brand… so that could mean shein is buying and reselling makeup products from other brands,Shien definitely got review robots 
9uVt0dTZUEA,Omg please do a video of reacting to SHEIN reviews  they are hilarious JAMES PLEASE. !!!,"i was actually laughing the other day because i was on shein ordering some stuff and wanted to buy makeup but didn’t know what it was like,so i went on youtube and typed in shein make up reviews and then it was a coincidence that James’s video popped up x",i but EVERYTHING from shein
x0usaMZFkBo,I love shein! The best way to do it is read the reviews!!,"I have coworkers who buy Shein and yeah, it's cheep and sometimes things fit. I get it, especially if you are a single mom on a budged but seriously. Just save your money and invest in clothing that will last longer.",I’ve never heard of shein but it looks like a made in China company that sells garbage
x0usaMZFkBo,I never bought anything on Shein...thank God lol.,"I do say they do have a little of ghetto clothing! but I'm a plus size girl, and so far Shein has clothes as a big girl I'd wear , that doesn't look like your an old lady",Had never even heard of Shein ...
x0usaMZFkBo,Wth is shein? Never heard of it lol,"I have never ordered clothing from SHEIN, just other stuff. And I check the reviews on items. It's worked out for me so far.",Thank you b for the PSA. I have not purchased anything of or from Shein and now I know to avoid them like a  on a sidewalk.
x0usaMZFkBo,I own a pair the fish flops but not from shein. Best. fishing. shoes. EVER.,I am glad I don’t buy from SHEIN. And I see so many of their clothes in local thrift and consignment stores. It’s just depressing to know how many people get ripped off and how terrible it is for the planet.,I bought a dress on shein simply because a review had pictures of someone's pet duck trying to eat the dress.
x0usaMZFkBo,Is SHEIN giving WISH a run for it's money? lol,"I have bought on Shein a few times and everything comes as described.  Sewn well and exactly the same as  the photograph on their page.
I don't know how other people have problems.  I would still buy from them...even after watching this....because I can't fault them.",Yea fact that’s Shein is run by a money hungry dude from a country that doesn’t give a lot of freedom to its people.
x0usaMZFkBo,I'm proud to say I've never heard of Shein until this video,"DON’T SHOP AT SHEIN



Tbh idc if it’s because of them being unsatisfied with their product but newspapers in my country did some research on Shein and their stuff gets made by slaves it’s from China so y’all are probably like ‘Well yeah obviously’ but I mean by Catholic idk if that’s the right belief but I think it was that not 100% but it’s because they believe in a certain god they don’t even have to believe in it if you are born in that community you are a slave 

Much like slaves in Europe before they discovered other continents to take control over and ruin
Now this is terrible and they pretty much live in slave camps so just don’t buy stuff from SHEIN and try avoiding stuff from China (it’s hard ik)






Fun useless fact Shein gets pronounced as She-in














Also for anyone wondering Shein was in the spotlight because people thought they were going to open a shop in the country but it was a showroom (they most likely made people unsure it was a showroom or a shop to get attention but if this backfired )",Watching this 15 mins after placing a SHEIN order and I’m now like 
x0usaMZFkBo,"More SHEIN reactions, please!! ","I've bought many times from Shein, and never been dissapointed. For me the trick to buy clothes online is to look very carefully at the measurements, and look at the comments with photos in them if possible, so you know how it looks in someone your size.  I mean,  you have to be realistic, and know you won't look like the model if your body type it's nothing like hers. Anyway, I didn't know they were this awful as a company, and I don't think I'll ever buy from them again, but unless other companies lower prices and offer more sizes, I doubt Shein is really gonna be damaged in any way...",Never heard of Shein.
x0usaMZFkBo,"Gather around Americans! It's correct pronunciation is ""shine"" (like shinning? You know? Great movie btw..!) Anyways ""shine""=Shein.
You're welcome :))","Most things I've bought so far from shein has been spot on and I've had them for over a year, multiple washes etc. The only thing I hate is the 20cm+ difference between waist and hips on jeans and shorts. Everyone's a hourglass shape apparently","I've never bought and probably never will buy anything from shein but I saw these ""shorts"" and they looked like scruffed jean underwear "
x0usaMZFkBo,I have ordered many things for SHEIN and have been very happy with 98% of it.,"never had a problem with shein. yes u do get some that not what u really wanted, or expect but they not as bad u think. and when u bring up the dumping etc not just shein ya know everyone does it. bit offended for that. not all sizes are accurate u have to check them properly before buying",Am I the only girl who has never heard of Shein? And for that I am thankful.
x0usaMZFkBo,I haven't ever had a problem with Shein.  Because I read the REVIEWS!!!!   I love Shein <3,Gotta check the reviews. I don’t buy anything from shein without seeing at least 10 different pictures from real reviews. Don’t regret buying anything from them except 1 shirt but that was my fault for buying it a size smaller,I agree with the majority of this. Shein definitely sends crap a lot of the times. But I do think that when people order things they’re not thinking with their body type in mind. It looks great on the model. But not everybody is shaped like a model. So it’s going to look a lot different. Just sayin.
V_Ju832wWI8,i literally downloaded shein 5 mins ago and have been browsing when this just uploaded. PERFECT,"I've bought a lot from Shein; some of it is hit, some miss. But I find myself not getting stuff from there as often b/c it falls apart after you wash them a couple times. Other brands might be more expensive, but the clothes hold up for longer, so in the long run they pay off. But every once in a while I hit on something of good quality (esp. swimsuits, although they're usually 1-2 sizes too small), so it's not a complete loss to shop there.",Shein is ban in india
V_Ju832wWI8,Thank you for also bringing awareness to the prayer mats that SheIn was selling as decorative pieces. <3,"In Asia that symbol is referring to Buddhism. I think that, because Shein is based in China, they are using the symbol as the symbol of Buddhism. When 8 first moved to South Korea I was confused as well until someone told me. Also, if you search Chinese, Korean Buddhism symbol, that is what would pop up.  just thought I would let you all know in case you didn’t. But I could see how it can easily be reserved negative if someone is wearing a necklace with that symbol.",you should do a boxy charm or Ipsy box review!
V_Ju832wWI8,"Mia, I love your videos- but please please please stop with the shein. Their factories use child labor and unsafe practices!!!!","Just a heads up. Only the Big mess-ups of Shein are reaching the Big Media, but they are under fire of small business owners too. They stole their designs, are selling them and refuse to take the designs down even when those independent, small businesses reach out to take it down.

Recently Wilde Mode and the owner of shop.FOC spoke out on Instagram about how Shein stole their design and isn't responding well to the messages they've sent them about it. And there are way more small brands affected by this, but these 2 I can name of the top of my head.","Please don't buy from shein,they are unethical."
V_Ju832wWI8,"i love you but please do not buy from SHEIN!!!! They do not pay their workers well, they have children making their clothes, you cannot support them and allow people to continue to mistreat its employees","People in the comments need to look at the Fashion Ethics Guide. Shein is horrible- for fast fashion and for a company in general. Yes fast fashion is everywhere, but y'all saying to 'do your research' yet are making ridiculous claims about how much clothes should/nt cost. Do your own research.","don't shop at shein anymore, they had a swastica neclace for sale, and you can reply to this if you want me to explain what that is"
V_Ju832wWI8,You’ll get great items from shein if you check the product’s material before purchase !!,"When I was studying Buddhist symbols for a story I was writing, I found out that the difference between the Buddhist version of the swatzika and the Nazi version is the orientation of the arms. I saw a picture of the Shein necklace and it is indeed supposed to represent the Buddhist version. However, the issue is not everyone is going to know these particular facts, so the decision to use this particular symbol was a poor choice on their part.",NEED A MAKEUP TUTORIAL ON THIS LOOK PLS
V_Ju832wWI8,i wear shein all the time and it is perfect,Not to hate because I love your content but.. isn’t shein a really problematic brand? Also why are we still supporting BLATANT fast fashion?,Creating outfits with the cheapest clothes on SHEIN?
V_Ju832wWI8,U introduced me to shein and it's awesome,"Mia seriously STOP doing these hauls. Especially from places like SHEIN and WISH. These companies are detrimental to the environment, underpay and overwork their workers, (primarily women of color by the way) and are just overall extremely unethical. Buying a shit ton of clothing from them every month only encourages them to keep doing what they're doing, and frankly it's not worth it. The clothes are poorly made anyway so seriously what is the appeal?? We all need to hold companies like this to a higher standard and actually start paying for clothes what they're actually worth when you include ethical labor and quality materials.",Do a SHEIN swimsuit haul!!
V_Ju832wWI8,i love shein!  i posted a shein haul too! i would appreciate it if anyone who reads goes check it out!,"Please stop supporting fast fashion places like shein :( they only encourage the massive waste the fashion industry has pushed, and they're cheap by exploiting labor laws in other countries vs US.",The thing is shein app is ban in my cntry(india) nd i m watching this video only for mia

i do hope you won't be doing any more shein videos tho, they're a terrible brand especially to their workers!!

V_Ju832wWI8,Great review! I appreciate the try ons and your room decor is inspiring!,"Please please please look into the other major problems with shein as a brand. They are problematic in so many ways and even though this isn’t a sponsored post, making a video about this company is still basically free publicity for this awful brand",You should do a SHEIN swimsuit haul
