JSb4_FxDciY,"I’m so sorry idk if ima get hate for this,  but I shop at Shein but I’m against Temu. I just think Temu is sketchy af and I have heard some shady stuff about it. I’m not against Shein because Shein has a lot of good products that are cute and cheap. Same with Temu but I trust Shein and not Temu. And I love how many coupons there are, I had 39 dollars and I gave it to my mom and she put that in her bank account and she purchased everything but obviously there are taxes so it turned out to be 44 dollars and I panicked cuz I didn’t want to take anything out of my Shein cart but thankfully more than 44$ dollars turned into 40$ dollars and my mom payed for the extra dollar and cents but I’m so glad there was a coupon to save me. It was a 30% coupon and I still have another one for next time I shop! Also, Shein quality is pretty good depending on what you’re purchasing. Also I had free shipping! Since every-time I buy stuff off Shein I buy a lot so it always gives me free shipping  Anyways please no hate if y’all can just reply to this comment with some advice of cheap online stores that have great products with great deals","Every big company does this kind of things, this isn’t a new thing and it’s not just shein, might as well boycott everything from Nike to nestle at this point","Ok but inflation so imma still use Shein Sorry but ain't nothing I can do about it. Besides, lots of companies do the same thing."
JSb4_FxDciY,"If people (who buy from shein all the time) are actually concerned just now: did it really needed that ""I need help"" stitched into the label? I mean that in a way where for me this topic was well known! I knew and boycotted ever since. I can't support this. I know many don't have the money to buy more expansive clothes - i mean more 
expansive than shein and not actually expansive stuff like IDK Chanel or even addidas (in germqny its called ""markenkleidung"" translated to  ""branded clothing"" but that doesn't Sound right for what I want to say so IDK) 
- and o understand here a bit. But people that do have money, why do you support this?? 

By the way Brands like h&m or Adidas Aren't that better than cheap brands like shein, for the environment and are still fast fashion. 

There are slow fashion companies, they are more expensive but i personally can't buy a lot of clothes from somewhere like extremely fast fashion like shein with good conscience. I can't afford slow fashion with all the Products I buy but two things: 1. You don't need that many clothes - fast fashion wants you to buy all the time but first you don't need em ans 2: the children working in places like this (and thats a lot the case in india, bangladesh and others tooo), the environment and hopefully your understanding and empathy will thank you for not supporting this. 

Ps: just look into fast fashion documentarys its shooking and 
Eye opening 


Edit: also there is this app called ""goodonyou"" with many ethical brands which you can search according to how much you wanna spend and it ranks a lot of famous brands like (h&m and others) based on how good ethical and for the nature they are. it was really eye opening for mw that's why I talk about it here",Bro shein is already banned in Morocco lol,"Honestly Shein is not cheap. Their materials suck and are cheap and the only reason why people continue to buy from them is because of the ""Afterpay"" I can buy thick 100%cotton here at my local Gap or Old Navy clothing for cheaper than Shein."
JSb4_FxDciY,"I will always preach this buy second hand from thrift stores or from brands who swear by fair trade practices. If youre good at thrifting you will find awesome pieces that nobody else has. Lots of brands thst sell fair trade products may be more expensive but those clothes will last years rather than less than a year from brands like Zara, H&M, and Shein. I had a pair of H&M jeans and they were terrible and blew out only after a few months. In contrast Ive had this flannel that Ive owned for 5 years and its still great with no holes or anything. I also have this awesome cotton shirt from tentree. It was $24 but it was totally worth it. Great brands I can recommend are pact, tentree, and patagonia.",Don't cancel shein please,me: i’m broke shein is cute but erong
JSb4_FxDciY,"I know times are tough financially. It’s hard sometimes to get new nice clothes, and SHEIN is affordable. But That’s why it’s important to ask your older relatives for hand me downs and visit the thrift store (: 
I grew up with a single mother, low income. I’m lucky to have older female cousins because everything they outgrow(excluding underwear) I get from them (: I’m 23 and I still do it though I have my own full time job. I mean if they’re cute, nice condition and fit, yea I’ll take it!",Sorry... I'm still buying from shein hun,The sad thing is some of us can only afford shein or second hand clothing.
JSb4_FxDciY,"I don't understand why people don't just buy second hand at charity shops/thrift stores. I literally have found amazing pieces of clothing for as little as £1, and the money goes to charity. Today my mum found a beautiful long coat in brand new condition for £3 at a car boot sale (I think they're called flea markets in the USA). Why buy super cheap shein stuff that's filled with lead and doesn't last long, when you can buy cheap good quality second hand stuff? People just want excuses to keep up with tiktok trends and buy £100s worth of stuff at a time. The shein haul tiktokkers are not buying stuff they desperately need.",Shein careless when it comes securing your credit card data from being hacked,this is why i don’t buy things from shien. i bought like 3 items from that company and the shirt i bought ripped almost immediately. i told my sis (who is 6 years older than me) and she said shein is a really brand that does child labor and there clothing is not good material. i’ve never bought a thing from there since
JSb4_FxDciY,"If that is the case with child labor in 3rd world countries and the products are VERY affordable. I recommend that someone who knows somebody from those countries find a trustworthy designated person to give a portion of donated money to each child in those factories (locations) where they are producing products for Shein. It would help those kids help their parents to eat a little better and have a little more basic necessities. It is because poverty and sick parents or parents that can barely manage a descent income to cover food and shelter costs. Do some homework, find someone trustworthy and reliable who can help. Send caring thoughts to the children, it wouldn’t be the company you would donate to, it be the children through a reliable source (sort of like a Guardian Angel). ",Dan I didn’t know this and I shop with shein sorry shein can’t do that anymore,"Soo..  someone didn't like how much shein is getting out of the market share, so they're starting a defamation campaign."
JSb4_FxDciY,I honestly don’t care shein products are good and I don’t buy from other brands I just love shein and I don’t care what happens behind,Imma still buy shein I’m sorry,My family having shein our whole life and never see this!
JSb4_FxDciY,Dude. This is old news. People shop from shein because every other good store is way too expensive for most families. I can buy a ton of clothes for the same price as one Lululemon align tank. I can buy 3+ full outfits and accessories for one align tank. Even Amazon is getting expensive. And thrift stores like goodwill are even getting pricey. Shein has good quality (ish lol ig as good quality as you can get for the price) clothes and is affordable to buy.  I had to restock my whole closet because I grew out of everything and shein made this so affordable for me. You can’t cancel a company for providing under privileged people with jobs.,Sorry I’m still buying from shein.,What about Temu and other cheap $1-2 items why just say Shein ??
JSb4_FxDciY,"Me sitting here, but I love shein: 





And nothing will stop me from loving it, all these rumours may not even be real about it","It’s not just Shein that does this 
I’m not saying it’s okay, but Shein’s clothes are really cheap and people buy it for that reason because they might not have the money to buy expensive clothes.",Why I’ve never ordered from shein or (now) temu
JSb4_FxDciY,I remember a while back I wanted to buy from shein but my mom told me not to I complained to her because it was hard to find places with clothes with pretty designs like sheins little did I know the truth but either way I’m glad I was stopped,"Shein does need to pay their employees more, but they should Not be shut down..Yes, it's a low wage, but it's still a Wage..Most of the ppl in 3rd world countries wouldn't even have a job if it weren't for companies like them..Shein doesn't need to be shut down, it needs to be improved, wage-wise..","Still gonna buy off SHEIN, need clothes my g."
lHNiD7lJo48,"no thanks, as broke as I am I am not going to trash the planet and get stuff that has lead and other carcinogenic substances in it. Not shopping anymore in those type of sites Wish or Shein or Romwe or any of those and I try not to buy in fast fashion brands as I don't see the point but to be honest I don't like or am late for most trends so I'm fine with it. And also the way they treat workers. I got my favorite clothes from second hand shops or platforms like vinted. My favorite overalls are from a second hand shop and they no longer are made and the material is so good; you should definitely invest in those types of things as so you are reducing your carbon footprint, helping our planet Earth and getting a unique, no longer exists item for a really decent price. I thought I wasn't going to like it but, well, turns out i did :)",shein out here plotting world domination fr,I wish people would stop buying from shein and especially promoting the site since it's terrible for the planet 
lHNiD7lJo48,"I do agree with everything you adressed in this video. But for me, I love to shop at Shein, for these reasons: they are very size inclusive, I am very very skinny and underweight, and everything I’ve gotten from Shein has fit me perfectly and made me much for confident, it’s the only place I can shop at that fits me. Second. We are not the wealthiest family, and Shein cheap prices are great because they have ok quality while being affordable. Third. On Sunday’s they offer free shipping on ANYTHING which is when I shop on their website. That’s all, I don’t agree with their child labor, but it’s the only place I can afford/fit in.",i swear i was just thinking about how she should do another shein video,"I was gonna say this in the last shein video but I'll just say it now, when she said they're cute she was talking about the clothes but when she was saying she hates them,she was talking about the company and their policies and practices rather than their products."
lHNiD7lJo48,"Please remember that what you wear does not define your worth.
And those who laud you merely for your outlook, think twice about their opinion and where it stems from. Do they really see you as you? 

Every penny, every dollar you spend becomes a source of support. 
Is a company like Shein- that doesn’t at all credit but rather shamelessly steals from small businesses who worked so hard on their craft in order to make a meaningful living- really worth your precious expense? Is the cost of fast fashion worth the suffering of the thousands working in poor conditions? Is the cost of fast fashion worth the destruction wrought on our environment?

Please don’t take your wallet for less than the potential goodness it can otherwise be used for.
Please don’t forget that with thoughtless convenience and fast-pacedness come at a heavy cost- one that hurts our environment, the working millions, and eventually you.

What you wear doesn’t define you. But the reason for why you choose what to wear surely does. Please see what truly matters and support those who design and create with love and integrity. As consumers, we have the ability to shift businesses. And so, please make every purchase with thought and care.",I'm always so surprised at how popular Shein is since the quality of their product always looks so bad...,"Once I realized that Shein is a Chinese company and I saw the lack in quality of their goods, and the long shipping delays and lacking of free returns, I have stopped ordering anything from them."
lHNiD7lJo48,"Tbh shein is awful we all can agree but how can we encourage the general population to support sustainability when the price of sustainable clothes is outside the budget of the majority of people? You have to make sustainable the easier option to fast fashion, that’s the only way people will give up fast fashion. How can you justify spending over 300 dollars on one article of clothing? Much less a *seasonal* item you can only where for a small portion of the year? Sustainability just seems like something for rich people to pride themselves on how they’re so much better than the Poors who buy cheaper quality stuff since that’s all you can afford. Also not to mention that high/luxury fashion has it’s ethical problems as well…","I slapped a dislike the moment she said its bigger than Amazon , Shein 10Billion valuation vs Amazon 1 trillion + . Dont talk companies girl ",I feel like Shein is hit or miss… and sizing is crazy 
lHNiD7lJo48,"People don't generally know this but it's pretty standard.... the Chinese Communist Party actively promotes and strongly encourages the stealing of intellectual & trademarked property from it's competitors... ie, western competitors. It's not against the law in China to copy & take profits. Ask Segway, they were bought out by Ninebot.... a Chinese competitor that stole the designs, sold copied versions... and ended up buying out the original. Let's not be shocked Shein that steal from small designers. They're not ashamed. They don't value personal creativity or ingenuity... they will just take and use and profit. And will continue to do so.",lol shein banned in india,"Many people are still so hypocrites and always think they fight for equality and justice in the world, meanwhile they spend money on fast fashion and follow trends and throw away old clothes quickly, killing the earth. I came across so many YouTubers , Instagram influencers or tiktokers who label themselves “vegan, black live matter, faux fur, animal lovers, Fight for global warming, etc” YET they post videos “ why people need to stop wear this, and stop follow this” which encourage ppl to throw away clothes. Plus always buy new cheap clothes at fast fashion stores such as Shein. Did they know these things also killing environments, encourage child labors, unfair labors in other country?  The reason people still don’t care about fast fashion is because they haven’t had that “ feeling bad” yet. Maybe people just fight for thing because it make themselves feel better. It is hard to be a good person if you don’t try to view the world differently. Listen and learn."
lHNiD7lJo48,"No hate, but everything I buy from Shein come in perfect shape. I’ve never had a problem with them. And I’m not trying to say that they aren’t good personality wise, but I love shopping there and that’s just my opinion",Bro shein is like littrelly a stealer,Some of SHEIN stuff is good but it’s really a hit or miss
lHNiD7lJo48,"I understand the appeal of buying a lot of clothes for really cheap, but please don´t do another shein haul. The clothes will be there to critisize but you spend $600 that only shows them that you support them. You could buy less items directly from the original creators and show us, the quality, the sizing, the availability or time to make them... I love the hauls from shein or wish don´t get me wrong, after all it IS more fun to poke fun at the weird sizing and aweful quality, but i just don´t watch them anymore.",Idk the validity to it but a decent amount of people have been posting that after shopping at Shein their information is popping up on the dark web,I literally just bought a bunch of stuff yesterday from them LOL had never heard of this thing before... I had purchased from belllily or something and it was the worst. Half the stuff I purchased from them I got an email saying to pick something else because it was no longer available. 4 months on and I'm still waiting for one more item they will likely never send. So I gave up on that. I was testing out another online shop and Shein was what popped up first lol
lHNiD7lJo48,"I have bought a couple of times from shein and I do feel really terrible for it now because of all the bad things it’s just that my family can’t afford to buy like expensive clothes… and most things here are expensive to me… 

Most people say like buy at thrift stores or second hand stores but there are stores 2 problems I have with them. There are very few of them where I live and like last time I went to one there were either A: little kid’s clothes like for a tiny 10 year old- which I would never be able to fit into because I’m very curvy 16 year old- or B: literally just grandparents old clothes that would look disgusting… on me and I actually care about what I look like and again sizes are just horrible for me…and they aren’t actually that cheap as people say not at least when I went there… 

But also… people need to start calling out other brands too not just shein… they aren’t the only company who have child labour and all of that yet it’s like only them who gets called out because they are big I guess… Like H&M which I am also guilty of buying from but… I know here in my country it’s the law for like good working conditions so the workers of them that work here do have it good but most stuff probably isn’t made in my country…","Hit check out, especially if it’s the collab clothes.

9uVt0dTZUEA,I’ve tried quite a bit of the makeup so here’s my thoughts. The concealer is fine. But elf camo is much better at the same price and you get more product. Eyeliner is trash. But the chisel eyeliner is awesome. The foundation is seriously the best ive ever tried. I’ve tried everything from elf to Mary Kay to Clinique and the Shein foundation is the best I’ve ever used period. And it’s only $10!!!! I’ve never tried their eyeshadow since I have other pallets but I’ve heard they are pretty good. Overall Shein has awesome makeup. I buy from them all the time.,I loooove Shein. Idk about the rest of it but the eyeshadow & brow products are on point,omg i got a really cute hoodie on shein and they gave it to me in the wrong size
9uVt0dTZUEA,Personaly I never tried SheIn make-up but I have tried skin care and clothes on their and it's honestly amazing stuff but James love we all know that that make up look looks fine it's not bad at all honestly your bad is my best,Hey girlfriend I love you so much and your make up tutorials but you need to stop talking so much and just get to the program,"As much as i hate shein, am i the only on who thought he looked amazing?"
9uVt0dTZUEA,"My mom and I have tried different a types of foundations from expensive to now cheap and believe me when I say the best foundation was cheap the first one from primark and now one from shein is just wow I’m loving it , I feel he’s been really extra when he says he doesn’t believe people actually like it I feel like the new make up that they have done is really good and the packaging is just wow, my mom finds it hard to find a foundation she likes and she’s in love with the one from shein",Actual People leave reviews not just randoms,"Please just be aware that some of SHEIN stuff have very bad toxin in them like lead poisoning.
Please wash y’all items it helps take out some of the toxins but not all"
9uVt0dTZUEA,"So not gonna lie. Let me give you all a review about them their makeup is insane. I bought very less products in the start but now i am so in love with them i bought all the makeups from them for my czn who is a bride. And she fall in love. 

Just a bonus point: buy SHEGLAM products the other ones are meehhh. But sheglam ones are best and pocket friendly too",as a person who used to buy from shein 24/7 when I first saw this video you know I had to click. And to be honest it doesn’t look as bad as I thought it was going to be,if he didnt know all the makeup was from shein he would of rated it rlly good. But i feel like he is giving it criticism because shein is known for some ripped off outfits what i disagree with.
9uVt0dTZUEA,It looks nice but if u don't like it it's your opinion but I think it beautiful James and yes I have tried SHEIN makeup it's not that bad it just like I would keep them but i wouldn't like for example I wouldn't wear the foundation everyday or like the eyeshadow everyday I get me but it alright I mostly like the clothes on SHEIN  also I love your vid can I plz have a shootout in your next video ,I do not want to go anywhere near Shein makeup after this vid.,When you hate a thing it will never work well with you because you hate it and this is exactly what is happening in this video like wtf I use shein makeup and everyone be like so surprised because of the looks of my makeup and they think that I did it with a makeup artist.... everyone I highly recommend buying shein ( sheglam for specific) it's so good 
9uVt0dTZUEA,uhmm i liked it a little or may be  but i guess your makeup products and secially your James Charles pallet was better then this  SHEIN!  but really enjoyed your vedio love you james  ...lots of love from INDIA...its your biggest fan  urru ,I mean shein sorry,Honestly I like the eyeshadow makeup and the products from shein arend so bad
9uVt0dTZUEA,i spent like 100 dollars on shein makeup lol i hardly ever wear makeup and when i do its super natural and dewy so the products actually work perfect for me... they arent hard to use i dont have to finesse them or anything i actually really like them a lot they arent super pigmented or anything and the eyeshadow palettes are so worth the money they are so inexpensive and i just wear eyeshadow for fun and to play with so i wouldnt want to spend a good 50 dollars on a palette anyways... :),I bay makeup from SHEIN for while and honestly all the products that I used was so good and even the brushes the quality was so good. But I didn’t try the products you used so unfortunately that not all the products good or bad,You should look for James apparel designs from Shein
9uVt0dTZUEA,"i don’t know why, but i think your makeup is really awesome!! i really love it!! i am buying from shein clothes & accessories & some thing, but never bought makeup or anything like that from it!

9uVt0dTZUEA,I love it I think looks really pretty but maybe with a different top it look better and match but I thinks so pretty and I love SHEIN,Bro better shut his goofy ahh up cus he be hating just cus it’s shein ,Shein literally uses child labour
9uVt0dTZUEA,Honestly I use some makeup for shein and I think it works great :) definitely good money wise and I love it,I guess SHEIN make up is for customers who don’t pay much detail on facebeats,I buy clothes from SHEIN
x0usaMZFkBo,"I have that heart vase and its FANTASTIC!! I get that Charlotte is crapping all over this brand/company and hates it, I am not a fan either of the fact they plug out so much product and is extremely harmful, but anything I've ever gotten from Shein, I have loved and I've had each piece for a couple years now. So I dont get the hate on how it falls apart within 1 wash, I've personally never had that happen. Plus, I also feel most people that are buying clothing arnt buying for THEIR body type and/or not measuring to make sure the sizing fits. The sizing is much different as its from China, we should all know this by now, however, buying skimpy clothing that you see on a model is not going to look the same or as good on our average, thicker or possible frumpy bodies. Just my opinion. I do agree, they need to figure out a better method because this fast fashion is incredibly harmful on our beautiful planet, but I have to say, I have clothing from Shein that I've had for years now and still look good and its not just 1 or 2 pieces...but that heart, don't be hatin on that heart, it's fantastic. ",Thankfully shein is banned in my country,and this my friends is why I always look through the reviews with pictures of people with my size and build. Saves me so much and also filters out a lot of the cheap bad quality stuff. Recently bought 2 playsuits from Shein and they are both very nice material and come out of the washing machine the same. I know it ain't good to buy from there but i'm on a tight student budget.
x0usaMZFkBo,"I honestly never had any issue with Shein, I'm always really happy with the clothes and items that I buy there... Most of the girls in this videos, as other comments say, they didn't even took the right size for them and/or they thought it will make them magically look skinnier/curvier as the models... 
I am a plus size woman who is tired of going to 10+ different shops for buying just a pair of pants or a top that actually fits and is affordable, I hated when my parents or friends told me to go shopping because I always ended up crying or angry for not fitting on anything cute or pretty (yes, being fat is not healthy, but I have the right to be dressed too and if possible with nice clothes). The few plus sized shops that I have around are super expensive and everything is horrible (patterns, colours normally everything dark or black  like I was going on a funeral every f***ng day, form completely squared - non existen curves, non existen practicality like too short that my boobs pop under...), not even my grandma would wear it. 
When I started shopping at Shein I was amazed that I finally could wear nice designs with brigth colours, with my exact size and for an affordable price sometimes even cheaper thanks to cupons and offers. At this point everything that I have is still working nice and even shoes for wide fit are amazing. Of course there can be crappy products, but thanks to reviews and pictures of people it's much easier to see how really the piece and materials are, and you also have the composition of the clothes, the type of adjustement (fit, regular, oversized...) and other details that can help you see if that's what you want/need or if it's something that will fit you better accentuating your shape in a good way. I always take a few hours before making an order, just to check all those details that I normally would search physically in a shop (ejems for example having pockets in the pants or in jackets).

And as for the complains about fastfashion etc... all shops do the same, all shops have workers in poor conditions in the typical countries, but the painful thing is high top brands who after paying riddiculous salaries to their workers, they still sell the product super expensive just to have the exclusivity and economical benefit they want. Some might say abaout quality, well, not even that, I've sometimes saw products from expensive shops and famous brands that weren't even sewn well and strings where falling + holes... Also some materials are really itchy and uncomfortable to touch/wear. 
Nothing that I bought so far in Shein had strings or holes where it shouldn't and the materials where quite nice and soft.","I have ordered a lot from the shein plus size range, and only ever had to send 3 things back.  Refund was immediate too.  People post photo and video reviews on there, the trick is to check those before considering ordering then you can see what you will actually receive","I used buy from Shein...But now I won't since they don't recycle  plus they have gotten so big, after seeing this I'm scared haha."
x0usaMZFkBo,"I'll be 100- I have bought from Shein a few times. It can definitely be hit or miss but what do you expect when you pay $5 or $8 for a cute top like the cartigan in the video? I never actually buy anything under $12 for this reason. I bought a black demin vest recently for $12. Fits great actually, its actual denim, but the cheap part is that the buttons, while attached great and strongly, make a jingle when you shake the vest and it has no pockets but I knew that when buying it.

You really cant buy with any expectations when you buy from Shein trying to save money lol its like tattoos. Want a cheap tattoo, expect cheap work. Want a good tattoo expect to pay at least $100 or more per hour. Ya know?",I never even heard of SHEIN until I saw this video. And it reminds me so much of Wish....why are people even surprised that they get shit like this?,"I bought 2 dresses off of Shein years ago. They were pretty good quality, but one of them was too small despite it being tagged as my size. I still have that dress as a weight loss motivator. Nowadays I don’t really buy clothes online anymore, because you never know how its going to feel and look on you."
x0usaMZFkBo,"I did not realize THAT'S why Shein was bad, so that was a bit of an eye opener for me. Personally, I've had decent luck with ordering from there, but I'm very scrutinous when I order because I KNOW I don't look like the models, not even the plus size ones. I make sure to update my measurements before I order and make sure I check the fit & style of each item I buy ALONG WITH checking the reviews, especially with pictures. Genuine reviews have been the best lifesaver for me when ordering off Shein. Sure, I've had a few fails (some of which on my part cuz I can't figure it out), but that's just my opinion.

That being said, I think Shein (and other places like them) are good for certain things. For example, I've used Shein and Wish to buy cosplay pieces since they aren't things I wear very much and since they're usually inexpensive it's not the end of the world if they don't last long. I also think Shein is a decent place to order ""hoochie mama"" clothes, like slutty things you wanna wear just for sexy times with your partner. Tbh when I order from Shein, that's mostly why I'm ordering from there, cuz ik it'll be quick and cheap and it's just gonna get ripped off me anyway ",I have some shein garments that I bought second hand and intend to make a rag rug out of when they can no longer be worn.,I have so much respect for Charlotte calling out shein. Slave labour and damaging the environment.
x0usaMZFkBo,"With shein you need to read the comments on it. Yes it takes a bit longer to buy things on the site, but I have found several awesome things! 
I found 13 tops, 6 bottoms, 3 sweaters and they are all lovely, wash nice, and are durable! Love them! 

My coworkers also have found many things on there as well!",It's so weird because I buy from Shein and I wear a lot of the stuff over and over again even jewelry. I have a necklace that I wear to go out and it's like very nice. I don't know like I just read the reviews very carefully I have a bunch of stuff from them and some of it I've had for years now I feel bad admitting this.,"These comments did not even surprise me. People that can afford normal size clothing shouldn’t be shopping at Shein. Plus size people often have nothing to shop towards because big corporations like to make ugly clothing for plus size people. Granted there are little to no income for skinny people as well but if you have money, STOP BUYING FROM THEM. As for plus size people buying them, DO NOT SHAME THEM."
x0usaMZFkBo,"I'm very particular with the 'fast fashion-ey' stuff I buy, cause I'm not spending $50 on one fucking shirt...that's absurd. I have 2 kids, and rarely buy shit for myself so when I do I want it to be cheap/on sale, and something I love.
Shein has done me damnnnn good! Like so many amazing things. Pay attention to reviews, very closely, esp for sizes. If you spend that time to really check you can do fckn good. And honestly most of it has held up quite good. I think I had 1 sweater that got a little hole, but it was like a grandma sweatey material that gets holes easy. The rest 
My first shein haul I spent 100 and got like 4 shirts, a dress and my absolute favourite jeans. Next time I spend a bit more and overhauled my whole wardrobe! More new stuff at once than I'd gotten myself in the entire last 6 years since I had my first kid. I'm also that awkward size that like I'm def not a size 0 lmao, but not plus size either so my options at a lot of stores are meh, Shein has everything I've always wanted for the in between sizes!","Damn, Shein is the only place that ever did me right. I got a dino skeleton swimsuit and it fits perfectly. Sucks they contribute to so much trash apparently. I make clothing and accessories from recycled tees just because I don't want to contribute to fast fashion trashing.",Oh no! I just bought a bunch of stuff from shein for vacation
x0usaMZFkBo,"I've ordered through SHEIN once. It wasn't a huge disappointment but also not a thrill. 

I order a LOT from EShakti and that is ALWAYS a thrill. Definitely more expensive but honestly, comparable to say, Target. I always use custom sizing to everything fits the body I actually HAVE and not some imaginary standard body, the fabrics are beautiful, the dresses are flattering and I feel gorgeous in them, and they all have big roomy POCKETS. (plus I can pick neckline, sleeve length, and skirt length...) I really will evangelize for them...LOL I wear every piece over and over and get SO many compliments on them.","I have ordered a lot from shein, (until i recently found out they do a lot of bad things) but i have NEVER had a problem with them or any of the clothes or stuff that i have bought.. I really dont understand how so many people can get so much wrong, guess i have just been lucky?","Although I understand people's opinions about shein,  they are the most inclusive in terms of shipping.  They ship to many African countries, while other companies don't.  And they have decent quality and price too."
x0usaMZFkBo,"I don’t have a lot of money that I can use so I often order from Shein and I’m gonna be honest, I’ve never been dissapointed from it, the quality was SURPRISINGLY GOOD, like Jesus, you gotta check out that dress I got, 25€ for a prom dress and it looked GORGEOUS, was SUPER comfortable and is still just as good as the day I got it","I once bought $50 of stuff from Shein, it was all crap, a huge pile too. I sent it all back. Never again.",I just cant bring myself to buy anything from SHEIN
x0usaMZFkBo,"I thanks the gods every day because my mum was a tailor and I grow up watching her work. Unfortunately I didn't pick up the actual craft (DAMN!), but I learned to see the differences between a good cut and a bad one, good fabric and rubbish, and I know straight away how clothes are going to look on me even if the model is size 0 whilst I'm not. Also picking the right size is a good start, but on its own it won't give you an happy ending: Starting from the same size, how fat and muscles are distribute on a body can still make a huge difference. All shapes and sizes can be be beautiful if you mind proportions and you dress sensibly. That said, even if you're shopping wisely at SHEIN, the fabric is still gonna be shite, so yeah. Don't. ",Aww man. The first girl got the Oompa Loompa overalls. Shame on Shein. Lol,I've ordered a lot from Shein a couple of years ago and I'm still wearing all of it.  I've never had any issues with their stuff
x0usaMZFkBo,"UNPOPULAR OPINION COMMING.
I am going to agree about some products having low quality (mainly in materials) BUT
I ordered a lot of things and if you actually pay attention to measures and reviews, you get good things. Got around 30 pieces of clothes and all fit perfectly expect one and that was just because I don't have hourglass figure just big butt.
Of course if you order from tall skinny side of Shein and you are size 12+ you won't look the same. D'uh 
There is a lot of nice things in plus size side. 
Wore and washed several of the items multiple times and they are still as new.
Also bought gadgets like travel humidifier and after 2 months still works perfectly.
You should always think about what you buy.","i do buy clothes from shein, but i actyually use it more than once because its somehow the only clothes that i found that fit me, that isnt extremly expensive. tall thin person with curvy thigh problems",Lolling at the Shein advert that came up I the video
V_Ju832wWI8,"Hello Mia, My name is Dana and I am 15 years old from Israel
Continuing your makeover series, I thought of a video idea:
""Makeover done by a fan"".
Everything will be done online, you'll  tell me what you want (in terms of weather so we can fit it to the clothes) and sizes, and I'll tell you what to order. I will build the outfits for the whole week.
It will only be off sites that you already know, like FASHION NOVA, PLT, Victoria's Secret and more.
For makeup, I'll show you some looks that you can recreate, and recommend you products
For nails, I have some examples of designs, things I've seen you've done befor
For the tan, which I know you love
I have a really good product to recommend to you that you will really love, but it's not a spray tanner, it's a self-tanning moss, so just keep that in mind
About the hair, I will show you some YouTube Tutorials for easy, fast, achievable looks that you will love
Plus, I think it's great for you to experiment with styles that are out of your comfort zone and that you wouldn't normally think to put together, because you and I have very different styles.
I really hope you like this idea, and if you do, please let me know, because I really put a lot of effort in this
Especially now that we're all in the house bored I think it's a great idea to have a bit of fun.
My Instagram is: dana_aloni10
If you want to be in touch with me, we can chat on Instagram or I'll just give you my number
Lovee
Thank you very much for creating great content,
Dana",Okay what the heck mia how did u know I was shopping on shein and needed advice,"I love you, but SHEIN is unethical. Please don’t give them anymore of your money."
V_Ju832wWI8,"Hey Mia !! I really love your content but I wish you would do more research before giving attention to a brand (mostly brands like wish, aliexpress or shein). I’m glad you addressed the recent controversy but it goes so much deeper than that. Fast fashion as a whole is so damaging to both the  environment and workers. Please take into consideration the ethics behind selling items for that cheap, all the work that goes into making clothing and how the people who are making $5 tops cannot make a living wage. Supporting these companies means supporting the mistreatment of women and children who are being taken advantage of for cheap labor all in order to make clothing that will fall apart after a season. You are truly one of the most kind influencers I watch and give back so much, so it’s really upsetting to see you neglect these terrible things and inspire people to fund these brands even further even if you don’t fully endorse them. There are tons of resources out there to learn about how harmful these companies are, channels like Sarah Hawkinson (who actually just did a video on shien !) and documentaries like ""The True Cost"" on Netflix. I really hope you see this comment and I would love to see you join the conversation on fast fashion !",You should watch Carrie Dayton’s video on Shein. Turns out they are S super shady brand.  They also stole a black artists art and blatantly marketed it as their own and pay their employees really crappy wages.,"If you order clothes from SHEIN, how many weeks will it reach you?"
V_Ju832wWI8,Do you know the pink pants on the SHEIN Picture I thought it was a skirt then I saw the wall in the crack it was so funny  because of the back if you know what I mean but then you said pants  omg I was laughing so hard.and I love all of your video I try to watch all of your videos and they are so funny and all of your Clothes videos are so good and I love  the old videos and you look so good in the green dress  it doesn’t look like it is from SHEIN you look so pretty in everything.,"When you ordered from SHEIN, did you have to pay a custom express fee?","I kinda wish Mia didn’t review Shein anymore, I read that they use child labor and don’t pay their workers enough."
V_Ju832wWI8,"I wasn't going to click on this video even though I watch every single one of your videos because I cannot support anything to do with shein. But I did want to come to take the time to try and educate on fast fashion and on sites in particular shein and romwe. I encourage doing your own research to decide for yourself but if you have the money to buy ethical fashion or second hand clothes i strongly encourage you to.  I really enjoy watching your videos and would be interested in you talking about more ethical brands a good app to use to find some is ""goodonyou"" I don't always agree with their rating but it can give some helpful insight to the brands we purchase from and is a quick way to see in general if it's a good place to buy clothes from.","Can you do a review of the clother of the show ""making the cut"" that are avaiable on the amazon store?",I just bought from shein not knowing all the controversies around it. I do t buy from wish for the mistreatment I’d their employees. What websites and stores don’t have these kind of problems? I honestly can’t think of any other than thrifting and I have problems things fitting me
V_Ju832wWI8,I have not seen this video yet but I actually got a whole entire haul off Shein and the clothes did not turn out so well most of them were see-through and really tiny. The jewelry is OK it just looks a little tacky and the shipping takes forever! I would say it’s definitely not worth it and to just go to your local mall and see what sales they have I have gotten a sweatshirt for $4.50 in a really cute crop T-shirt for three dollars and obviously I was able to get it immediately because I went to a store to purchase it!  Most stores have sales! You just have to figure out which ones have the best sales like most of my clothes are from forever 21 because they always have the best sales! I also got a pack of make up brushes and you get what you pay for the quality isn’t really that good most of the brushes have longer bristles so it’s weird applying makeup with them. I would also assume that they aren’t very clean!,"Another huge problem with shein is that they promote fast fashion, which makes their products cheaper and also cheaper made. For example, I bought a top that was great, but I bought a pair of jeans that smelled like oil and has never come out. Also, fast fashion is an extremely awful part of the fashion industry, and no I myself can not afford the sustainable fashion brands, so I go to thrift stores and secondhand shops.",You should try shein shoes!
V_Ju832wWI8,"The whole reason why Mia started reviewing the brands that she does (Wish, Shein, YesStyle, Romwe, etc) is because she gets comments for these brands to get tried. She said herself at the beginning that she was doing this primarily because it was so heavily requested. Other comments were saying how she can probably afford more sustainable and higher quality items and bashing her for promoting fast fashion to her ""platform"", but her platform does NOT consist of a lot of people who are able to comfortably support better brands; they're looking for cheap things because that's what they can afford. They wanted someone they could trust and also someone who could try on a wide variety of these brands and different styles on their behalf instead of spending their own money first. She donates the items that aren't her style or do not fit, and has ""revamped"" certain items as well, so it isn't going to waste. She didn't go into detail about why she hasn't been sponsored by Shein yet but she mentioned she was contacted, which means she is not endorsing this company and other similar brands for her own gain/use, but because she has an audience that keeps requesting her to do it. Her channel is focused on being budget and DIY friendly, so these are the options available for her (if she did a video on more sustainable brands, it would probably be a lot more expensive and be geared towards a much smaller, specific portion of her audience).","Mia as much as I love these videos and myself have bought from Shein, I learned they’re really sus and use child/slave labor ): it makes me so sad but I just want you to know so you can look more into it if you want",Do a SHEIN swimsuit haul!!
V_Ju832wWI8,"Hey Mia, you seem like someone with a very big heart and my only mean here is to help. I would love to see you educating yourself a bit more on the problems surrounding brands like Shein. And this is not me saying what u have to do or what u have to buy but i think that you would also rlly enjoy learning more about the brands you shop from and recommend to your viewers. There's a documentary called ""The Crue Cost"" which is very informative and a great way to understand the impacts fast fashion has in our world, hope u find it helpful ;)","Mia seriously STOP doing these hauls. Especially from places like SHEIN and WISH. These companies are detrimental to the environment, underpay and overwork their workers, (primarily women of color by the way) and are just overall extremely unethical. Buying a shit ton of clothing from them every month only encourages them to keep doing what they're doing, and frankly it's not worth it. The clothes are poorly made anyway so seriously what is the appeal?? We all need to hold companies like this to a higher standard and actually start paying for clothes what they're actually worth when you include ethical labor and quality materials.",I own the butterfly t shirt and it is one of the most used pieces from shein that I own!
V_Ju832wWI8,"Little tip to anyone who may need a little side hustle for extra cash during these hard times, try the fetch rewards app. You scan recipes to earn points for gift cards like Visa and Amazon. It’s safer to use a gift card on shein too. They even accept receipts up to 14 days old which is amazing if you got a junk drawer or wallet full of receipts. Also, I ask my fam for theirs too! And I have a code for 2000 free points. It’s C2B76. I’ve already gotten $150 worth of clothes from shein.","Besides Shein’s unethical labour practices, many of their clothes are extremely trendy looking, so that people just won’t want to wear them after a year or so.  Throw-away fashion like this is just not sustainable for the planet.",I can’t wait for my Shein order to come —w—
V_Ju832wWI8,"Swastika is a auspicious symbol in hindu religion as cross is in Christianity . People do wear swastika necklace that resembles faith in God , winning of good over bad and good luck . Hindu religion is one of the oldest religion in the world.  It's associated with Hindus from ages and have a significant place in their worship and faith. It's not just associated with Nazis. We should know that before making somebody take down such a product which is same as cross to Christianity or hijab to islam nd apologize for it, shouldn't we ? Morever Swastika is a Sanskrit word which is old hindu language and Nazi thing way ages after that so traditionally or initially it's just a sacred hindu symbol. I donno for what people forgiving shein for selling something which is somebodys oldest faith and religion. Morever, the swastika symbol is with straight horizontal and vertical lines as the necklace was  where as the one associated with nazi is in diagonal lines . I expect people to know the whole picture before having an opinion.",Hit like if u are an Indian and have come here after Shein has been banned .,You should do a SHEIN swimsuit haul
V_Ju832wWI8,"i love u, and i've bought from shein before but i have been questioning supporting businesses like this recently. i'd love to see you buy from black owned shops or more videos of you revamping old clothes (: <3","People having a go at the poor girl  she brought the stuff before realising what Shein was like, she now knows the details and can go forward with what ever she wants to do, stop having a go at her, I've brought from Shein in the past I'm still going to wear the items I've brought I'm not wasting them I just now know not to buy from them in the future.",Wasn’t Shein the company that was hacking into social media accounts of customers!?!?
