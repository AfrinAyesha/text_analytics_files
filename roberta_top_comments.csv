JSb4_FxDciY,We still love Shein though there clothes are very cute,I tried ordering from shein before and I’ll never do again the quality is below the standard,I buy from SHEIN every week idk what y’all are on nothing is wrong it’s either they’d I’d it themself or something
JSb4_FxDciY,"Love shein, good quality and affordable",I thought is was because shein was stealing designs but this is worse,Or maybe it's just a publicity stunt to bring down shein
JSb4_FxDciY,My girl will buy like 20 outfits from this site for under $100 lol Im amazed at the priced Shein sells they stuff for. I wish it was as cheap for men.,Shein is the worst…. Who doesn’t know this by now?,I forgot about shein 
JSb4_FxDciY,I honestly don’t care shein products are good and I don’t buy from other brands I just love shein and I don’t care what happens behind,"theres even worst things about shein like stealing designs, toxic products, and even bugs in the packaging. IMO its the worst fashion brand to exist",People arguing that other companies do this don't realize the sheer scale that Shein is doing this
JSb4_FxDciY,"Nah I'm still buying from SheIn lol, their clothes are good quality so idrc how they make them",Is that why I ordered a clip from shein and it literally is so bad when I took it out of the package it was so loose and was about to break and I can’t even wear it it’s a waste of money!,"the printed tags are just a mistranslation, the sweat shop workers making the clothes aren't the ones printing them. they're probably designed by someone who gets payed a decent wage then printed out en masse and just sewn on by the workers. obviously this doesn't explain the handwritten notes but also worth mentioning, how would shein employees in china be able to write not only in english, but in perfect natural-looking cursive?? not saying they don't need help, but i really doubt that's real"
JSb4_FxDciY,Lol literally every company uses swear shops! iPhones?? Give me a break. They’re just mad people are getting the same looks for more than half the cost. And alot of my shein clothes are great quality and I never had any messages like these on my tags. Ever.,"Sorry I’m not cancelling shein . I feel bad but I’m not canceling fashion Nova  either. Temu etc. , I am a huge Internet shopper. Who knows what else is going on behind the scenes of 1 billion companies we shop from . I’m sure  even the narrator of this post  is probably wearing a shein  shirt right now. Hush.","yeah but who buys clothes from shein, real talk for a sec ago, i didnt know what shein is."
JSb4_FxDciY,awww such hard working kids I'm going to buy some more clothes from shein to support them,SHEIN is the worst and most blatant. Y’all on crack,I just bought from SHEIN yesterday and I had no idea that they were doing that
JSb4_FxDciY,shein only? lol why do you think major companies have factories is Asia???,"While I was watching it my shein package arrived, I didn't like the things I bought! I will stop buying there",I thought they were talking about the Shein from Jimmy Neutron
JSb4_FxDciY,I love shein and will continue to keep shopping there. There clothes are affordable. The country needs to handle their own problems,"I hate shein because of its degenerate apparel, but global warming is a blatant lie. It’s as real as evolution.",Bro it's literally everything every brand does that I don't know why they are only calling out shein like every brand does it its not just shein
JSb4_FxDciY,"I’m about to look at the labels of everything my kids ever bought from Shein lol. This is wild though…$1.25??? Is that daily, weekly, or what?",Wtf... The only thing i knew about Shein is that they copy outfit from other brands.  This is messed up,"My mom works at Amazon and she says the work conditions are bad. I doubt it's as bad as this but still, why call out just Shein?"
lHNiD7lJo48,"Thank you for your video. Shein bigger than Amazon?! Whatt?? That genuinely bothers me. Love your videos and content!! ""SHEIN HUNNY 
...WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"" ",That makes me sad because i get nearly everything from shein so I’m sorry I’m on sheins side sorry ,Guys before the vid I literally SHEIN idk
lHNiD7lJo48,I’ve never bought from shein and I intend on keeping that way. I’m glad you’re bringing awareness to this. Love your videos! Ps. Ayyeee I’m part of the early squad,"I’ve wanted to like shein so much but the clothes are just trash. Itchy, ill-fitting, morally-corrupt, awful sizing. I could go on and on. HATE.",I have a life hack. If you wear shein ring and your area that has worn the ring turns green Then put on rubber gloves on Then it turns into a color Then its gone( if it does not work Then Idk What went wrong)
lHNiD7lJo48,"Hi from ,  I think Shein supporting up and coming designers is admirable. Are they attempting to make up for their mistakes or are they genuinely interested in showcasing talent? Let's hope it is positive. I think you should support your designer friend.",The shein x clothes are always ugly.,What about romwe it's just like shein and I'm not being mean by that it's just romwe is close to shein but I think romwe is a bit better but idk
lHNiD7lJo48,I don't care lol I love SheIn. Let's be honest I'm probably not wearing the outfit but a couple of times and the price point is exactly that. I can wear cute stuff and not go broke!!! Love them!,Yeah I got some stuff from shein and I didn't really like it,I don’t understand why know one is noticing that shein is a drop shipping  store getting their cloths from china
lHNiD7lJo48,"Please Hope we need more SHEIN reviews. For entertainment purposes, of course  definitely not because we love to watch you rage at fabric","I like shein clothes but it honestly hurts me when people spend THOUSANDS of dollars at shein not knowing where these came from. There are kids younger than 10 working in harsh labour conditions, being paid under minimum wage and some people just don't care that the Earth is being destroyed by this and the non-sustainable fabrics used by the compant. :/",I kinda find it confusing to what she is saying and her opinion 1 second she wants to never but from shein then she wants to buy a dress
lHNiD7lJo48,"We love detective Hope you should order and do an in depth review of the clothes! Also, an interview with your friend Jessica about how they’re treating her as a featured clothing designer…?",Shein is the worst,Idk the validity to it but a decent amount of people have been posting that after shopping at Shein their information is popping up on the dark web
lHNiD7lJo48,You should try Chic Me. Clothes are super cute idk if it's similar to Shein tbh lol,I would try to buy from the actual designer if possible!  I hate Shein ,I shop at SHEIN but I had no idea 
lHNiD7lJo48,"Hello! Thanks for this very clever description of the Shein empire and the way it messes with your mind...and purchasing desires! Gave me a good laugh....though I realize it is a very real issue we face...cheap, fast and affordable....or socially conscientious? Sigh. All the best on your excellent channel. I'm a new subscriber!","I purchased from Shein once before and every single item was terrible quality, awkwardly fitting, and I haven't worn any of it. It is such a shame. I think we would all rather pay a few extra dollars to have a slightly higher quality, and so designers could be paid for their designs. 

I wont ever purchase from them again.","I have an etsy shop selling crochet designs, and know a LOT of other creators like me have had their designs stolen by shein! They steal their designs and sell them for ridiculously cheap prices. A lot of people don't realise crochet cannot be done by a machine (unlike knitting) so everything crocheted has been created by someone's hands which takes HOURS. The green and pink  sweater you showed will have taken someone possibly over 10 hours to produce so should be sold at a price point that allows the creator to be paid fairly for their labour, which they are clearly NOT as places like Shein sell them for dirt cheap. It makes me so sad!! So just remember, most of the 'slow fashion' crochet pieces you see around are fairly priced based on the hours of hard work and love that had to go into making them."
lHNiD7lJo48,I love shein but this video it funny so ima give it a thumbs up :),"I cant personally buy from shein. Theyre beyond hope for me and i hate the idea of them getting my money. They have done things that are irredeemable. The nazi necklaces, trying to sell Muslim prayer mats as an ""aesthetic"", culturally appropriating traditional South Asian wear- theres a level of HELL NO that comes with a brand that has shown to be  anti Semitic and Islamaphobic that just aint it for me.","I just ordered from Shein for the first time…out of dozens of pieces I ordered, I only kept 4  Quality is definitely iffy!"
lHNiD7lJo48,Haha “gaslit” by Shein!  love these videos,"In 2020, I did some shopping at Shein but my final purchase was an absolutely shoddy blazer - it was scratchy, cheap & downright horrendous. After that blazer, I never bought anything from them again.  It's a shame because they do seem to offer a plethora of basics that would be nice to have but then, the quality is not worth it. I bought a mock-neck top and I believe after 1 wear, it had a hole on the side of it -_-.",I don’t know if you mean the picture at 2:20 it’s not a dress from shein
9uVt0dTZUEA,"Loved this! PLEASE do a part two with different Shein products as well as a follow up saying whether or not this irritated your skin, thanks for the awesome content!",I can't believe he tried the worst make up from SHEIN!  I honestly feel sorry for him and his face!,I guess SHEIN make up is for customers who don’t pay much detail on facebeats
9uVt0dTZUEA,Hey James so my sister loves SHEIN (not make up) but she always say that there lashes are great I hope you could do a part 2 and try them thank you!,"Shein makeup is kinda a thief, like a bootleg of a good mark. I tried it, it came even worse than you could expect",I don’t understand the people saying he didn’t know it was shein when he literally says it’s from shein multiple times
9uVt0dTZUEA,I loved the foundation  doesn’t look bad at all. Also that lipstick looks so velvety and shiny. Will defo have to give them both a try. Thanks for your honest review ,I dont like James but damn is his make up tutorials helpful,"I don’t know how I managed to be this early, but I’m here early  unlike anything you buy off SHEIN "
9uVt0dTZUEA,So cool I love shein is was fun to watch keep going your amazing ,the sad part tho is that the amount of lead content in Shein’s clothes scares me enough to nOt try the makeup.. since China’s labor rules allow a wAy higher percentage than FDA approved concentration ,"If u just showed this makeup look in a video without
 saying anything about it being shein i would never guess that it was."
9uVt0dTZUEA,I have NOT tried any SHEIN makeup but it wasn’t THAT bad lol it just needed a little shaping but for me just getting into this I LOVED this video lol I want the Puff sparkle ball,Shein is worst gud that its banned in india they literally just copy everything,dont know if its true but i heard shein is known for child labour
9uVt0dTZUEA,"You look amazing with the full face shiglam makeup from shein .
If you didn't say it' was full-face makeup from Shein, I would not believe it's Shein.
I would be happy if you could do a full face makeup with warm nude colors for everyday makeup look from shein
I really, really liked the look .... 
I believe that a full face shein makeup look with warmer colors will be no less beautiful than the blue shades.
 Thank you.",James you have 24.5 subscribers to your channel; you are reviewing Shein and you do not mention neither once the how unsustainable their products are... this is very disappointing,You should do a guessing if it’s shein or original brand challenge
9uVt0dTZUEA,"james, i’m so glad you did this video haha, i was just wondering if i should buy makeup on shein bc makeup is expensiveeee… thanks for answering my question ","I hate shein a lot, I got a foundation they said was ALLERGY FRIENDLY and I got a huge allergic reaction.",; the fact im wearing a shein hoodie rn..
9uVt0dTZUEA,"i don’t know why, but i think your makeup is really awesome!! i really love it!! i am buying from shein clothes & accessories & some thing, but never bought makeup or anything like that from it! 
but i actually love your look & maybe i will try one day buy it there!!",It being from SHEIN could be worst,the shirt that he’s wearing looks like it’s from shein
9uVt0dTZUEA,Thank you so much for helping out because I order a lot of make up from SHEIN the primer I actually bought it and it’s so amazing I love it in the foundation that in the shade nude I’m gonna buy it thank you so much for helping me out,"I miss SHEIN. I was completely a shein freak, but In India it's still banned ",Please review shein outfits next!
9uVt0dTZUEA,honestly i think u made it look really good! the lipstick looks really good on you….now i kinda wanna try shein makeup lol,I mean shein sorry,shein haul next
x0usaMZFkBo,Don't lie those are finger condoms lol.  I'm happy that I haven't contributed to the hell that is Shein.  Anyway love your videos Peace and love to you and your family ,Weirdest thing I saw on SheIn and I almost bought it just because it was weird--flip flops for your hamster. Little rubber ones like you wear to the pool. A wholly useless product that I would cherish for the sheer stupidity of it.,Shein is either a hit or a miss
x0usaMZFkBo,Their bikinis are great. Everything else is meh. You HAVE TO shop the honest reviews. Look at the pics to see the real fabric. And just hope you get the same fabric you see in the review before they move on to a new batch. ,"It's unfortunate that Shein is not good for the environment. I will look into other brands. However, I didn't have this experience as almost everything I bought from Shein I liked on me. It didn't fit exactly like the models, but I knew this as I am shaped differently than them.",The thing about shein aswell is everybody has a different body type so when you buy something thinking it will fit just like the model when you come to realize you have a different body type and it fits you way different i bought i dress from them fit ok but was way to long as i am a short person
x0usaMZFkBo,I have never had these problems with shein so I’m so curious how the heck this happens to so many but never me who normally have horrible luck with online shops haha,A lot of these are just people with different body types than the models so yeah it’s gone look different. Also SHEIN is the worst,I have no idea what SHEIN is.
x0usaMZFkBo,I love shein. Ive only had a couple not fit right. Lol,There is so much Shein crap in my local thrift stores lately. I bought a shein pullover hoodie at goodwill and it was new but in 2 washes it's all pilled and the threads are coming out. It's absolute trash.,I don't understand how people buy stuff without looking at the pictures of the real objects in the reviews!!! 
x0usaMZFkBo,I love Shein. Everything I have gotten has been great. Not sure why these people are struggling ,"I’ve never heard of Shein.

But this is the #1 reason I hate buying online.  You don’t know what fits you right or looks good on you.",Never heard of Shein until today. They’re just Wish rebranded.
x0usaMZFkBo,I love shein but I only order shirts cause no pants ever fit me lol,Im sorry how can u not know shein is globally and ecologically problematic,"people know they will get crap from shein... including other dodgy sites such as wish... yet people continue to buy from them

Let's face it though - theres a lot of women who see an item on a model that is completely different to their figure and the item is made for a stick figure...yet they still buy it and wonder why it doesnt look good on them"
x0usaMZFkBo,"I've actually had pretty good luck with SHEIN. Some items weren't perfect, but none were a disaster, and some were freaken amazing.",There needs to be better laws in regards to fast fashion like that. What an absolute waste and pollution of the planet that Shein is. Disgusting. At least send it to communities as kindling for fire. Jeesh,"The only things from shein that’s lasted are lacey panties, lingerie, and my daughters swimsuit bottoms that’s she’s had 2 yrs now"
x0usaMZFkBo,"So far everything I bought on Shein has been great. You just have to shop for your body type. I’m short round, I buy empire wait line stuff. I’ve also bought several shorts which I absolutely love. So far so good. Knock on wood.","Why are people still buying this garbage? You can buy better made clothes you can wear more than once from places like H&M, New Look, Next etc for roughly the same price. Everyone knows shein is awful quality for awful for the planet! No sympathy for anyone!",SheIn a cage
x0usaMZFkBo,"Thanks Charlotte for sharing stats about the waste that SHEIN puts out! Love it. Love learning about these things on your channel. So many of  these larger corporations are the major drivers of climate change, but they shove blame onto consumers, by doing things like starting campaigns. I just found out the ""no straws"" campaign was funded primarily by the fishing industry when it was discovered that they are responsible for more than 70% of all plastic waste in the oceans!",ive orderd from Shein and WISH many times but never got  it so wrong stuff .... i got small sizes from wish but thats all from SHEIN ive always got what i bought .. but people should know it can happen if u order from places like them :/  and yeah they arent good for the planet :P ive gotten more bad stuff buy ordering a coloringbook from a online bookstore that had weird WHITE STAINS inside of the coloring book ...,Fish head.  Fish shoes.  Dress from Shein
x0usaMZFkBo,"I love Shein!  
I've bought my nieces clothes from there and haven't had any issues. There are different designers that sell through that site, very similar to Zulily, so I'm curious who the designers are on the items in the video.",I literally order off SHEIN all the time an I’ve yet to receive a bad item. So I live SHEIN. Sorry others ain’t having as much luck as I am with it.,Shein is just the Wish of clothing.
V_Ju832wWI8,"Hullo Mia! Always love your videos, was wondering if you could do an Eggie clothing review? Please and thank you. You’re wonderful!",Hey Mia - Shein got banned in India. Pretty bummed about it :(,When she started her PSA I thought it was gonna be about the Shein info leaks...
V_Ju832wWI8,"Mia thank you for addressing the controversy over Shein, I think it's great you took the time to do so and I appreciate it as a viewer. Also I absolutely love your makeup",I literally just tried Shein. I was not impressed and then I saw that they suck as a company ,"In Asia that symbol is referring to Buddhism. I think that, because Shein is based in China, they are using the symbol as the symbol of Buddhism. When 8 first moved to South Korea I was confused as well until someone told me. Also, if you search Chinese, Korean Buddhism symbol, that is what would pop up.  just thought I would let you all know in case you didn’t. But I could see how it can easily be reserved negative if someone is wearing a necklace with that symbol."
V_Ju832wWI8,"Mia, I love you so much and think you are absolutely amazing, so please do not take this in any way as hate. I am an environmental major and have learned that fast fashion such as shein are incredible carbon intensive, pollute water with chemicals, and propel sweat shop industries. Just to keep in mind, thank you so much, love you!!!","please dont support shein mia :( im not saying everyone has to only wear sustainable fashion because its not easily accessible to most people, but shein's quality is so poor, their customer service is awful and their low prices and rate of adding new items to their site just shows how awful the working conditions for the sweatshop workers must be",try venzifit online store review for us. I really dont know what to expect. My friends say its very reliable but they order alot while i just want to order one thing
V_Ju832wWI8,girl PLEASE just wear your cute ass dresses anywhere anytime they looks so cute and casual you never need an occasion to wear a cute fuckin dress okay thank u for this video i loved it gunna buy my shein cart,I feel so bad that SHEIN is banned in India :(,"SHEIN has also sold sacred prayer mats as fashion rugs (which is very problematic). They also are a huge player in the fast fashion industry and use slave/unethical labor. I would do some research into it before buying from them again, because I had no idea until I did some research. Just thought I would let  you know!"
V_Ju832wWI8,Do you know the pink pants on the SHEIN Picture I thought it was a skirt then I saw the wall in the crack it was so funny  because of the back if you know what I mean but then you said pants  omg I was laughing so hard.and I love all of your video I try to watch all of your videos and they are so funny and all of your Clothes videos are so good and I love  the old videos and you look so good in the green dress  it doesn’t look like it is from SHEIN you look so pretty in everything.,I dont shop at shein...I also dont shop at wish. Wish sells crack pipes and things to snort drugs. That's a big WTF why would you. It's disgusting.,I was just scoping out shein!!! But I was still unsure because I was about to drop like a lot of money 
V_Ju832wWI8,"I'm so glad I found your channel! You seem so down to earth and realistic about what to expect and even though some of the pieces weren't 'perfect' or *exactly* what they were advertised as, you didn't shit on the company and I really seriously love and respect that. Thanks for such a great review haul :) I appreciate it!","BOYCOTT SHIEN!!! Not sure if everyone heard, but Shein was selling a nazi symbol necklace on their website. As a jew it is absolutely disgusting and not enough people are talking about it! Please DO NOT support this company!!!","Ugh, I think the butterfly tee is from an other brand, called Minga London, I thought that I have seen it before somewhere and just now it popped in my IG feed... Maybe Mia should try their brand and address this thing, shein has basically stolen this item from the other brand "
V_Ju832wWI8,loving your reviews but you seem on the side enthusiastic - please hope genuine reviews as we will promote you UK,"I hate shein , cause once I had 22 items okay so iam from india it's a big thing for me , so when my dad was ordering all the stuff it was of 244 dollars and when I ordered it , it was telling dear indian customer we have stopped delivering to our Indian customer because of this covid 19 



I was soooo said and I was crying and I deleted that app after 7 months okay today I wanted to download shein but it's not in my playstore  iam fell like the sadest person ever ",#BoycottShein
V_Ju832wWI8,"I’m so glad you said something about whats been going on! When I read the title i was like “Oh no, sweet Mia is going to get canceled!” But I knew you would never associate yourself with negativity such as Shein’s choices. You’re always so inclusive and you try so hard to keep positive & high-spirited content on your channel. I hope people see your heart, not just through this video but through your spirit that radiates through your videos. Love ya, angel ","Mia seriously STOP doing these hauls. Especially from places like SHEIN and WISH. These companies are detrimental to the environment, underpay and overwork their workers, (primarily women of color by the way) and are just overall extremely unethical. Buying a shit ton of clothing from them every month only encourages them to keep doing what they're doing, and frankly it's not worth it. The clothes are poorly made anyway so seriously what is the appeal?? We all need to hold companies like this to a higher standard and actually start paying for clothes what they're actually worth when you include ethical labor and quality materials.",Plz do a Shein wedges haul 
V_Ju832wWI8, appreciate how honest you are with your reviews. hope you will appreciate how honest your supporters are when they inform you about how terrible this brand is  ,OMG NO!!! Don’t buy from Shein!!!! It’s VERY not ethical!!!! They have been seen stealing other artwork from people without giving proceeds!! These clothes are also produced in sweatshops which is ABSOLUTELY disgusting!! DONT SUPPORT FAST FASHION!!,The thing is shein app is ban in my cntry(india) nd i m watching this video only for mia
V_Ju832wWI8,"Hi Mia! I love watching your  Clothing Haul videos! and your makeup challenge videos! which kinda means all your videos. hehe. I came across a clothing site called Dresslily! was hoping you could make a review about their clothing. I always want to order, but then I end up not to.  They seem to have reasonable prices especially on sale. let me know what you think! :D",They shut down shein in india and i am absolutely devastated and yes that seems like an exaggeration but i mean i miss shopping....,"""Reviewing ShEaAn products""  "
